####Various simulations run on ns-3 simulator to test different aspcts of a network and how they behave under different network specifications

1) Measuring TCP throuput on simple 2 node dumbbell topology

2) Measuring Efficiency of DropTail vs RED queing on a dumbbell topology with varying nodes on each leaf

3) Measuring throughput of a wireless network from small (100 nodes) to large (1000 nodes) scale clusters within a fixed measured environment (area of 100x100, 500x500, 1000x1000)

4) Measuring rate of propogation of a Worm on a closed network over various topologies (star, tree, dumbbell and combination fo the three)
